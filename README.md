# A Simple Sudoku Solver API

## Introduction
This project is intended as a portfolio piece, and as a personal reference for several technologies which I have used at work.  I've deliberately chosen a (very) simple algorithm and to make a small (initially only one endpoint) API around it, so that it's easier to follow what's going on.  The real "meat" of this project is to be the various supporting technologies in use, such as Docker.

## Project Goals:
* Build a simple API which will solve Sudoku puzzles.
* Demonstrate as many industry-relevant technologies that I'm familiar with as possible.
* Showcase best practices as much as I can.
* Create a reference for how to use different technologies.

## Project Anti-Goals:
* Actually create an API or website that will be useful.  This project is strictly a demonstration piece.
* Create performant or optimised code.  Again, this is purely a demonstration piece.
* Simplicity.  While the code will be as easy to follow as I can make it, there will be convoluted additions to the system in order to bring in as many extra technologies as possible.  I.e. it's unlikely a production version of this system would need a Redis cache, but I'll aim to include one here to demonstrate working with Redis.

## Deployment:
// TODO

## Run Locally:
// TODO

## Testing:
// TODO

## Solution TODO List:
* Clear up auto-generated files, i.e. Dockerfile, Blazor pages, etc.
* Add projects/sort out solution structure (and add a paragraph in here about it?).
* Set up dependency injection system.
* Add first solver endpoint.
* Add Postman testing suite.
* Add K6 testing suite.
* Add the actual solver algorithm.
* Add web page for users to interact with.
* Add a DB (Postgres).
* Add a cache (Redis).
* Set up running the project in a container (Docker).
* More goals and endpoints to follow...
